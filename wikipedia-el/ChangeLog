	appropriate faces.

2005-05-24  Paul Pogonyshev  <pogonyshev@gmx.net>

	* wikipedia.el (wikipedia-mode): Set `show-nonbreak-escape' to nil
	locally.  Set `eldoc-documentation-function' in addition to

	C-l' will set a link from the word under point and the next two
	words.

	each domain.  Remove `image-link-prefix' property.
	(wikipedia-get-domain-safe): New defsubst.

	than `start' (happens in an empty buffer.)
	(wikipedia-show-region-markup): Likewise.
	(wikipedia-html-entities): Add all greek letters.
	(wikipedia-known-html-entities-regexp): Also match numeric
	entities (like ``&#1234;''.)

	string.
	(wikipedia-electric-quote): Insert opening quote after opening
	parenthesis, bracket or brace.

	`wikipedia-delete-markup-subregions' before a call to this
	function.
	(wikipedia-show-links-markup): Make sure that when creating a
	short-style link (``[[word]]ending'') the ending consists of
	word-constituents only.
	(wikipedia-mode): Make lines starting with '=', ':' and ';' also
	start paragraphs.  Set `imenu-generic-expression' so that `imenu'
	finds all subsections.
