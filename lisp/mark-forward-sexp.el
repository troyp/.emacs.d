;;
;; Description:
;;
;; mark-forward-sexp behaves in a similar fashion to vim's 'co' and 'ci'
;; keystrokes, by jumping forward(/backward) to the contents of matching
;; delimiters and marking for change those contents. For example:
;;
;;   C-c i "
;;
;; will jump to the next matched-pair of "..." and mark the inside
;; contents. Unlike vim, this version crosses lines and has a strong
;; understanding of s-expressions.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Add the following to your emacs config:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/mark-forward-sexp")
;;   (require 'mark-forward-sexp)
;;
;; and some keybindings, e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'mark-forward-sexp)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c O") 'mark-backward-sexp)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i") 'mark-inside-forward-sexp)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'mark-inside-backward-sexp)
